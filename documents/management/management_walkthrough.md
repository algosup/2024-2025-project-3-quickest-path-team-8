This document is a walkthrough of the management artifacts of the project. It will guide you through the different documents that have been created to manage the project, providing a recommended order in which to read them.

## 1. GitHub Management

We use GitHub as a common platform for our project, we decided to use it for management documents as well. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-8/issues) will be used to track milestones and bugs.

## 2. Recommended order to read the documents




### 2.1. Milestones

We will use GitHub Issues milestones to track the progress of the project. We grouped the milestones by category, for example Documentation. You can find the milestones [here](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-3-quickest-path-team-8/milestones).

### 2.2. KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are metrics that help us measure the success of the project. You can find the KPIs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QBYoiKVUNZqS7M1ySczrvGzFi-i2YFGg94BD5h7vSKY/edit?usp=sharing).

### 2.3. RACI Matrix

The RACI Matrix is a tool used to define roles and responsibilities for each task in the project. You can find the RACI Matrix [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ks8q_6eMADyZjF8dcJEFqMipRGraHNshNAtUv45jEs0/edit?usp=sharing). 



### 2.4. Risk Management

Now that you are aware of the responsibilities of each team member, you should read the [Risk Management](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ppuQtH63KG5h03xVnGx2j9pGNSQNAlM/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117083838720275060736&rtpof=true&sd=true) document. This document outlines the risks associated with the project and the mitigation strategies that have been put in place to address them.

### 2.5. Weekly Reports

Every week, the team will create a Weekly Report to summarize the work done during the week, accompanied with a feedback of the team about the current feeling about the project. You can find the Weekly Reports [here](weekly_reports).
