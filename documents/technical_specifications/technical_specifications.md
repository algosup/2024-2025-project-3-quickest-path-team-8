## 1. Audience

This document is primarily intended for:

- Software developer - to understand the user and technical requirements, and to guide decision-making and planning. Help them understand risks and challenges, customer requirements, and additional technical requirements and choices made

Secondary audiences

- Program manager - to validate against the functional specification, and the client expectations
- QA - to aid in preparing the test plan and to use it for validating issues.
- Project manager - to help identify risks and dependencies

## 2. Project Overview

This project involves developing a high-performance C++ software solution to calculate the quickest path between two landmarks in the United States. The solution will be accessible via a REST API, supporting both XML and JSON responses. It will use a dataset with 24 million connections between landmarks, with travel times. The software must handle large-scale data efficiently, return results within 1 second, and ensure the path is within 10% of the shortest possible duration. Data integrity checks are also required for the dataset to ensure correctness and connectivity. 

## 3. Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Landmark | A point in the graph representing a location in the U.S. |
| Graph | A network of nodes (landmarks) connected by edges (paths) with associated travel times. |
| DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) | A graph that doesnâ€™t contain cycles, used to model the landmark connections. |
| REST API | A web service that exposes functionality via HTTP endpoints, in this case, to query the shortest path. |
