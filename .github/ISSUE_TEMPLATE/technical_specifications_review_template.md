## Technical Specifications Review

### What has been quality checked?

#### **Purpose and Alignment with Functional Specifications**

- [ ] Does the document clearly link each technical detail to the corresponding functional requirements?  
- [ ] Are all features and mechanics from the Functional Specifications fully addressed?  
- [ ] Is the technical implementation consistent with the project’s objectives?  

#### **Scope and Audience**

- [ ] Does the document focus on the technical aspects required to achieve the project’s goals?  
- [ ] Is the document accessible and understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders?  
- [ ] Are all technical decisions justified within the scope and constraints of the project?  

#### **Development Environment Setup**

- [ ] Are the hardware and software requirements realistic and clearly defined?  
- [ ] Are setup instructions detailed enough to allow developers to begin work without delays?  
- [ ] Are coding conventions and workflows described to ensure consistency and collaboration?  

#### **Folder Structure and File Organization**

- [ ] Is the proposed folder structure logical and easy to navigate?  
- [ ] Does it support efficient development and maintenance?  
- [ ] Is it scalable to accommodate future updates or additional features?  

#### **Data Structures and Implementation Details**

- [ ] Are the data structures and coding methodologies clearly defined and maintainable?  
- [ ] Are the provided code snippets and guidelines consistent with best practices?  
- [ ] Do the implementation details support clarity, modularity, and scalability?  

#### **REST API Implementation**

- [ ] Is the REST API design aligned with the project goals, including support for XML and JSON responses?  
- [ ] Are the input and output formats well-documented and easy to use?  
- [ ] Does the API handle queries efficiently, meeting performance requirements?  

#### **Data Validation and Graph Checks**

- [ ] Is the data validation process clearly defined and implemented?  
- [ ] Does the tool ensure the graph is a valid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) without loops?  
- [ ] Are connectivity checks robust and well-documented?  

#### **Performance and Approximation Heuristics**

- [ ] Are the algorithms optimized for handling large-scale datasets within the 1-second query response goal?  
- [ ] Do the heuristics used meet the 10% approximation rule for shortest paths?  
- [ ] Are time and space complexities clearly stated for the main algorithms?  

#### **Testing and QA Support**

- [ ] Does the document provide sufficient detail to support quality assurance testing?  
- [ ] Are workflows, folder structures, and coding conventions designed to facilitate debugging?  
- [ ] Is there a clear plan for validating technical implementations against the specifications?  

#### **Clarity and Accessibility**

- [ ] Is the document structured logically and easy to follow?  
- [ ] Are all technical terms and concepts explained for the intended audience?  
- [ ] Are visual aids like diagrams, tables, or mockups provided to improve understanding?  
- [ ] Are none of the paragraphs more than 3-4 lines long?  
- [ ] Does the document feature a table of contents?  
- [ ] Are all the links functional and link to the right destination?  

#### **Visualization and Documentation**

- [ ] Are mockups, diagrams, and code snippets accurate and actionable?  
- [ ] Do visual representations align with the described workflows and structures?  
- [ ] Are they sufficient to guide implementation without ambiguity?  

#### **Consistency with Project Goals**

- [ ] Does the technical implementation enhance the overall user experience?  
- [ ] Is it aligned with the timeline, resources, and objectives of the project?  
- [ ] Do the technical decisions support both short-term deliverables and long-term goals?
