## Functional Specifications Review

### What has been quality checked?

#### **Vision and Objectives**

- [ ] Does the document clearly define the purpose and goals of the software (e.g., calculating the quickest path between two landmarks)?  
- [ ] Are the objectives specific, measurable, and actionable (e.g., response time within 1 second, using heuristics for approximation)?  
- [ ] Does the vision align with stakeholder expectations and project requirements (e.g., compliance with REST API specification)?  

#### **Scope and Boundaries**

- [ ] Is the scope of the project clearly outlined, including the core requirements (e.g., implementation in C++, API specifications)?  
- [ ] Are the inclusions (e.g., XML and JSON response formats) and exclusions reasonable for the project's constraints?  
- [ ] Is the reasoning for excluded features or functionality clear and justified?  

#### **Target Audience and Accessibility**

- [ ] Does the document effectively identify and address the needs of the end-users and developers?  
- [ ] Are considerations for accessibility and inclusivity adequately described?  

#### **Functional Requirements**

- [ ] Are the functional requirements clearly defined and unambiguous (e.g., path calculation using approximation heuristics)?  
- [ ] Do they provide enough detail to guide implementation and testing?  
- [ ] Are all critical features and interactions (e.g., bidirectional connections in the dataset) described adequately?  

#### **System Behavior and Mechanics**

- [ ] Are the system behaviors or mechanics well-defined and intuitive (e.g., REST API response handling)?  
- [ ] Do they balance usability with complexity to meet user needs (e.g., XML and JSON formats for different integrations)?  
- [ ] Are they logically consistent with the objectives and vision of the project?  

#### **Deliverables and Performance Metrics**

- [ ] Are the deliverables (e.g., source code, test suite, data validation tool) clearly outlined and achievable within the project timeline?  
- [ ] Are performance metrics (e.g., response time, accuracy within 10%) defined and actionable for evaluating success?  

#### **Design and Usability**

- [ ] Does the document provide sufficient design references (e.g., data structure examples, mock endpoints)?  
- [ ] Are the design components aligned with the project's goals and user needs (e.g., clarity in REST API implementation)?  
- [ ] Does the document outline user-friendly interaction methods and workflows?  

#### **Testing and Validation**

- [ ] Does the document outline a clear strategy for testing and validation (e.g., ensuring graph connectivity and integrity)?  
- [ ] Are criteria for success and failure defined for key features and behaviors?  
- [ ] Are potential risks or edge cases (e.g., large datasets, bidirectional checks) addressed in the testing plan?  

#### **Clarity and Readability**

- [ ] Is the document structured in a way that is easy to navigate and understand?  
- [ ] Are technical terms and concepts adequately explained for the intended audience?  
- [ ] Does the document include helpful references like glossaries, diagrams, or tables?
