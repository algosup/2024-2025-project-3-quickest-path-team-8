## KPI Review

### What has been quality checked?

#### **Alignment with Project Goals**

- [ ] Do the KPIs align with the project’s objectives of optimizing software performance and response times?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs directly linked to critical deliverables, such as efficient route calculation, REST API functionality, or data integrity checks?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs reflect priorities outlined in the call for tender, like C++ implementation and heuristic optimization?  

#### **Specificity**

- [ ] Are the KPIs specific to requirements such as REST API response formats or data validation?  
- [ ] Is it clear how each KPI supports objectives like pathfinding accuracy within 10%?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs easily understood by team members, including developers and testers?  

#### **Measurability**

- [ ] Can the KPIs be measured with project tools and resources (e.g., API response benchmarking, graph validation tools)?  
- [ ] Are metrics quantifiable, such as response times or data validation completion rates?  
- [ ] Is there a clear methodology for measuring and analyzing each KPI?  

#### **Relevance**

- [ ] Do the KPIs focus on core requirements like API performance, algorithm efficiency, and dataset integrity?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs encompass short-term tasks (e.g., initial validation tools) and long-term goals (e.g., maintainable code)?  

#### **Attainability**

- [ ] Are the KPIs realistic within the project’s timeline and constraints?  
- [ ] Do they reflect team capacity and technical expertise?  
- [ ] Are they neither overly ambitious nor too conservative?  

#### **Time-Bound**

- [ ] Are there deadlines or milestones associated with each KPI, such as weekly API performance tests?  
- [ ] Does tracking frequency align with deliverable timelines, like the final test suite?  
- [ ] Is the allocated time for achieving certain KPIs reasonable?  

#### **Adaptability**

- [ ] Can the KPIs evolve if project requirements change?  
- [ ] Do they allow for iterative refinement, considering heuristic improvements or API updates?  
- [ ] Is there a review mechanism to update KPIs when necessary?  

#### **Balance**

- [ ] Do the KPIs cover diverse project aspects (e.g., technical performance, usability, stakeholder feedback)?  
- [ ] Is there a mix of leading indicators (predicting performance) and lagging indicators (evaluating results)?  
- [ ] Are KPIs balanced between qualitative measures (e.g., user satisfaction) and quantitative benchmarks (e.g., API response time)?  

#### **Stakeholder Inclusion**

- [ ] Were stakeholders consulted during KPI development?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs address stakeholder concerns, such as those of the Program Manager and Technical Writer?  
- [ ] Are the KPIs presented in a clear and understandable way for stakeholders?  

#### **Reporting and Visibility**

- [ ] Can the KPIs be tracked and reported easily using tools like dashboards or spreadsheets?  
- [ ] Are reporting mechanisms clear and accessible for team members and stakeholders?  
- [ ] Do the KPIs provide actionable insights during reviews?
