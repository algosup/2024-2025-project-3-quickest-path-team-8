## Weekly Report Review

### What has been quality checked?

#### **Alignment with Project Goals**

- [ ] Does the report cover progress toward implementing the quickest path algorithm in C++?  
- [ ] Are REST API developments and adherence to XML/JSON response formats documented?  
- [ ] Are performance goals (response time within 1 second, heuristic compliance) addressed?  

#### **Clarity and Detail**

- [ ] Are the accomplishments described with enough detail to understand the current state of the C++ implementation and REST API development?  
- [ ] Is the language clear and free from technical ambiguities?  

#### **Actionable Challenges**

- [ ] Are challenges such as handling large-scale datasets, ensuring data integrity, or meeting performance goals discussed with actionable steps?  
- [ ] Are solutions tied to both functional requirements and performance constraints?  

#### **Clear Next Steps**

- [ ] Is the plan for the next week aligned with specific deliverables, such as completing the test suite, data validation tool, or refining the heuristic algorithms?  
- [ ] Are milestones measurable and tied to deadlines?  

#### **Balanced Information**
